# Photo Picker Demo

A lightweight SwiftUI project designed to refresh and improve knowledge of Camera and Library APIs. The app enables users to take photos directly or select them from the photo library, showcasing best practices for modern iOS photo handling.

## Features

### Photo Picker

- **Take or Select Photos:** Choose to take a photo (one at a time) or select multiple photos from your library.
- **Preview Selection:** Preview picked photos with a tab view‚Äîswipe right/left to browse your selection.
- **Manage Selection:** Cancel and clear selected photos or add them to the **Selected Photos** section. Action buttons are available both in the view and in the toolbar.

### Selected Photos

- **Photo Grid:** View all the photos you‚Äôve added to your selection grid during app usage.
- **Manage Grid:** Use toolbar actions to enable selection mode and choose which photos to delete.
- > **Note:** This project is a demonstration of Camera and Library APIs. All data is stored in memory only‚Äîyour selections will be lost when the app is closed.

## üöÄ Possible Improvements

This project is an ongoing learning tool, and I plan to explore additional architectural and feature enhancements in future demo projects. Some possible improvements for this app include:

- Persisting selected photos using Core Data.
- Adding a detail view with editing tools to modify and enhance photos.
- Implementing a "Save to Library" feature after editing.
